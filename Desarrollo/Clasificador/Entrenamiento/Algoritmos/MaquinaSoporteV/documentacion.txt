*Effective in high dimensional spaces
*different kernel funcitons can be specified for the decision function 
*if the number of features is grater than the number of samples we get over-fitting, we can avoid it choosing kernel functions, and regularization terms
 *suvport vector machine has a complexity of quadratic

*Kernerl function
	-Linear:linear
	-Polynomial:poly
	-rbf:rbf
	-sigmoid
this is specified by keyword kernel initialization
linear_svc=svm.SVC(kernel='linear'
rbf_svc=svm.SVC(kernel='rbf')
